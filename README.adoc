= Riverbank

[WARNING]
====
Development on Riverbank has stopped, please consider link:https://github.com/delta-incubator/delta-sharing-rs[delta-sharing-rs] instead.
====

Riverbank is a Delta Sharing Server implemented in Rust. The Delta Sharing
Protocol is still very early on and so this project may see significant
changes.

== Using

Riverbank uses link:https://rust-lang.org[Rust], which will be needed to build
and run a local development version of the service.

The `config.yml` should be configured with the test shares desired. Secrets for
accessing resources in AWS S3 can be set in the environment or via a `.env`
file in the repository root directory, for example:

.The .env file
[source,bash]
----
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=foo
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bar
----

=== Environment Variables

|===
| Name | Required | Description

| `AWS_REGION`
| yes
| AWS region for S3 buckets

| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
| yes
| IAM access key

| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
| yes
| IAM secret access key

| `RIVERBANK_ADMIN`
| yes
| Username for the built-in admin user (e.g. `root` or `admin`)

| `RIVERBANK_PASSWORD`
| yes
| Password for the built-in admin user

| `RIVERBANK_URL`
| no
| Client-facing URL for generating share links (e.g. `http://example.com/api/v1`)

|===

In production, download a pre-built release and set up your configuration files
appropriately.

In development, you can run  `cargo run`, or if you have
link:https://github.com/passcod/catflap[catflap] and
link:https://github.com/passcod/cargo-watch[cargo-watch] installed `catflap -p
8000 -- cargo watch -x run` which will start up the development server at
`localhost:8000`.

Or you can use the provided docker-compose file to start the database and the riverbank server

```bash
docker-compose up --build --force-recreate && docker-compose down --volumes
```

You can use the API documentation at link:http://localhost:8000/apidocs/index.html[localhost:8000/apidocs/index.html].

== SQLX data json update

=== Start the test postgres db

```bash
docker-compose up db
```

=== Start a rust docker environment

```bash
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/src rust:1.54 /bin/bash
```

Inside this container you can update/crete the sqlx-data.json file

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:supersecretpassword@host.docker.internal:5432/riverbank
cd /src

cargo install sqlx-cli
cargo sqlx prepare
```
